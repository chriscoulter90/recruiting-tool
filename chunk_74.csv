Title: 
Defensive Line / Recruiting Coordinator / Director of Player Personnel


Phone: 
989.964.4479











Bio






Niklas Gustav joined the Cardinal Football coaching staff in March 2025 and filled the role of Defensive Line / Academic Coordinator / Director of Player Personnel.
""Excited to announce the new addition to the Cardinal Coaching staff in Defensive Line Coach Niklas Gustav. Coach Gustav brings a wealth of expertise and experience with him to SVSU,"" said Brady. 
Gustav joins the Cardinals from Eastern Michigan University, where he worked with the defensive ends—a position he played himself in college at NAIA powerhouse Morningside.
Prior to EMU, Gustav coached at Concordia University Ann Arbor for two seasons (2023 & 2024), where he helped develop NCCAA Defensive Player of the Year and NAIA All-American David Cagle.
""Goose is a winner!  He is an expert on what it takes to play in our defensive system, having been an All-American Defensive End at Morningside. He is an excellent communicator and a relentless technician,"" Brady lauded.
The Hamburg, Germany native began his coaching career at his alma mater and helped bring the team a third NAIA National Championship in 2021, the first as a coach for the program. While with the Mustangs, he coached four all-conference players and helped develop NAIA All-American Weston Schultz. Gustav also gained experience coaching long snappers and specialists and is a certified strength and conditioning coach.
""In a short time, he has made a huge impact on our defensive line room, and our players love his energy, attention to detail, and his intensity. I couldn't be more excited to welcome Coach Goose to Saginaw Valley State!"" said Brady.
As a player, Gustav was an All-American, conference player of the year, a three-time all-conference selection, and a team captain. He was instrumental in the back-to-back National Championship seasons at Morningside in 2018 and 2019.
""I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to join the SVSU Football program! Coach Brady has built a program and culture that is truly special and full of great people! I am determined and excited to help elevate this program to the next level and compete for championships!"" stated Gustav.

Tackle Jordan van den Berg was an All-ACC Second Team selection and Zeek Biggers earned honorable mention all-conference honors.
 
Garcia spent the previous season at Duke, helping the Blue Devils lead the ACC in scoring defense at 19 points per game which was 16th-best nationally.
 
He also spent time at SMU, Temple, Central Oklahoma, and Angelo State as a graduate assistant. Garcia started his coaching career at New Mexico Military Institute, where he also was a two-time all-conference selection before finishing his career at Eastern Kentucky where he started 10 games his senior year.
 
Jax State has won nine games each of the last three seasons and is coming off a Conference USA championship and an appearance in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl.

cbarnette@alasu.edu







                    Chris Barnette is in his second season as Offensive Coordinator and quarterbacks coach on the Alabama State football staff.

Barnette's offense offensive rushed for 2,372 yards, including four games with 200-plus yards rushing. ASU ran for a season high 308 at Bethune-Cookman, 211 yards against Florida A&M, 203 against North Carolina Central and 204 against Alabama A&M. Alabama State rushed for 100 yards in 9-of-11 games missing the 100-yard mark with 97 yards against Alcorn State and Grambling State. The Hornets out rushed 9-of-12 opponents while the 17 sacks allowed are tied for third in the conference.

Barnette coached at Winston-Salem State as offensive coordinator and was the receivers coach at South Carolina State University before coming to ASU.

Before South Carolina State, he was the Offensive Coordinator/ Quarterbacks coach at North Carolina A&T State University from 2015-2023. He was the play caller and coordinated all aspects of the offense as well as preparing and organizing practice/game plans. While at A&T in his first two seasons as the Aggies offensive coordinator, the Aggies won the MEAC, the Celebration Bowl, and the Black football national championship. Also, in his first two seasons, the Aggies offense was ranked No. 1 in the MEAC in red zone offense.

In 2021, Barnette was a part of the Bill Walsh Diversity Fellowship with the Washington Football Team. He assisted with the wide receivers during training camp and organized team activities.

Prior to accepting the position at A&T, Barnette spent the past 12 years at nearby Division III Guilford College as a player, student coach, and offensive coordinator. He served the Quakers well in all three capacities making the GC offense one of the most prolific in Division III as a player and coordinator.

Barnette's coaching career at Guilford began in 2007 as a student assistant working with wide receivers. In the spring of 2008, Barnette served as the offensive coordinator for the Elancourt Templiers of the French Elite League. The team went 9-3 and reached the league championship game.

As a player, Barnette caught a school-record 266 passes for 2,953 yards and 30 touchdowns in a four-year career that concluded in 2006. As a senior, he was named an All-American by the American Football Coaches Association and D3football.com. It would be his second straight All-American season. He led Guilford's pass-catchers in each of his four years. In addition, the Quakers' first ODAC Offensive Player of the Year, Barnette, played in the 2006 East Coast Bowl and Aztec Bowl senior all-star games.

The 2025 ODU defense held opponents to a program record under 10 points eight times and produced its first shutout since 2017 in a 33-0 victory over Troy. The Monarchs twice held opponents under 200 yards of total offense, inlcluding a school record 138 yards allowed in the shutout of Troy.
 
ODU finished second in the Sun Belt in total defense and scoring defense, finishing 14th in the country in scoring defense with 18.5 points allowed per game, and also finished second in the league in rush and pass defense.
 
The Monarchs led the Sun Belt and finished 14th in Red Zone defense and led the league with 39 sacks and tied for sixth in the country in sacks per game.
 
Safety Jerome Carter set the single season school record with six interceptions, while fellow safety Mario Easterly led the team with 80 tackles.
 
ODU began the year with depth at linebacker but All-American Jason Henderson retired due to injuries after game one and his backup and second team All-Sun Belt performer in 2024, Koa Naotala, played in just one game. Senior Seth Naotala and true freshman Jackson Forrest picked up the slack combining for 116 tackles and seven sacks.
 
Seiler helped guide a host of Monarchs to all-conference honors, including Carter who earned second team accolades, Kris Trinidad and Jeremy Mack Jr. who received third team honors and Chris Forbes and Mario Easterly who earned honorable mention honors.
 
The 2024 ODU defense produced some memorable moments, including holding SEC foe South Carolina to under 300 yards in the season opener, forcing five turnovers against East Carolina and coming up with a turnover the first nine games of the season and in 10-of-12 games.
 
In the opener against the Gamecocks, ODU held SC to 288 yards, its third lowest offensive output of the season, allowed just 114 passing yards and forced two turnovers. The following week ODU tied a school record with four interceptions against ECU, while safety Jahron Manning became the first Monarch since 2014 to have two interceptions in one game.
 
Manning and linebacker Koa Naotala each finished in the top 10 in the Sun Belt in tackles, as Naotala led ODU with 88 and Manning recorded 85. Naotala led the way for the defense on the All-Sun Belt Conference team, earning second-team honors, while Manning and Kris Trinidad were named to the third team and Mario Thompson and Denzel Lowry received honorable mention accolades.
 
Seiler's defense was without two-time All-American Jason Henderson for all but one game, as he redshirted while recovering from an injury.The 2023 season saw the defense under Seiler allow 50 less yards per game than it did in the 2022 season and force 21 turnovers. ODU was stout against the run finishing fourth in the Sun Belt in rush defense and fifth in the league in scoring defense. The defense scored three touchdown with a pair of interception return touchdowns, one from Kris Caine and one from LaMareon James, and a fumble return from James. The group also had several long returns, including Wayne Matthews' 55 yard fumble return and Tahj Ra El's 40-yard interception return.Linebacker Jason Henderson led the country for the second-straight year with 14.2 tackles per game and became the first player since Luke Kuechly of Boston College to lead the country in tackles in consecutive years. Henderson also finished fourth in the country in tackles for loss. He earned multiple All-America honors, including first-team accolades by Walter Camp and The Sporting News.ODU was the only team in the country to have three players record 100 tackles on the year, as Henderson, who had 170, was joined by Matthews with 135 and Terry Jones with 107.Seiler led linebacker Jason Henderson to ODU's best individual performance by a defensive player in program history. Henderson led the country with 186 tackles, finishing seven tackles shy of the FBS record, while breaking ODU and Sun Belt Conference records. Henderson was named an All-American by five publications, becoming ODU's first FBS All-American.Linebacker Ryan Henry tied for the team lead with four sacks and 7.5 tackles for loss despite missing three games.ODU's defense led the Sun Belt and placed 12th in the country in Red Zone defense, and 32nd in the country in sacks per game.In his first season on the field as the leader of the ODU defense, Seiler implemented an aggressive defense that saw ODU tied the program record in holding teams to 20 points or less five teams and place third in Conference USA in rush defense and 35th in the country in rush defense, the highest finish in program history. The ODU defense had five players earn all-conference honors, including both inside linebackers, the position Seiler coaches, and cornerbacks Roger Cray and Tre Hawkins III and safety R'Tarriun Johnson.Young led ODU with 104 tackles and broke the school career record with 350 stops, while Cray finished tied for 11th in the country in pass breakups.Seiler was ODU's nominee for the Broyles Award, given to the top FBS assistant coach in the country.Seiler spent the 2019 season at West Virginia and will be the defensive coordinator and inside linebackers coach at Old Dominion.Prior to the 2019 season, Seiler coached at Kansas State for 10 years.
